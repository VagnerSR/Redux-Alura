# Redux-Alura


I did an online Redux course with JavaScript. However, since I wanted to implement Redux using TypeScript, 
I created a repository and shared it on the course forum, hoping to receive assistance in structuring it with TypeScript.

## Technologies:

React.JS <br />
TypeScript <br />
Redux <br />
Redux Toolkit <br />
Redux Saga <br />


## A little more on the project

TypeScript proves to be extremely beneficial when dealing with more complex tasks as it prevents the occurrence of common mistakes.
What I find particularly valuable is that TypeScript enhances the understanding of the overall project structure, especially when utilizing 
Redux and Redux Saga, where is possible to encapsulate logic and write readable, maintainable, and reusable components.
<p/>Even though I gave my best shot at using TypeScript correctly, I'm not entirely confident that I nailed it. That's why I decided to share my 
code on the course forum, reaching out to other learners for their feedback and assistance.
